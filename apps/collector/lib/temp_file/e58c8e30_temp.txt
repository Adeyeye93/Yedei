Course Duration
 5 Months (20 sessions, 1 session per week)

Course Description
This interactive and hands-on programming course spans five months and introduces kids aged 6 and 13 to the world of coding. Students will start with Python to learn the fundamentals of text-based programming and gradually transition to Scratch for practical application. By the end of the course, they will be able to create games, animations, and simple applications.
